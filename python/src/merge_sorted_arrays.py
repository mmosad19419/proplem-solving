    given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order,

    Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

    The final sorted array should not be returned by the function,
    but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this,
    nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged,
    and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
